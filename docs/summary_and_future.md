# Summary and Future Work

## 1. Project Summary
This project demonstrates a secure IoT data management system leveraging blockchain and decentralized storage. By integrating smart contracts, device authentication, and IPFS, the system ensures data integrity, provenance, and resistance to tampering or forgery.

Key achievements:
- Secure device registration and authentication
- Immutable storage of data hashes on blockchain
- Decentralized storage of raw data on IPFS
- Transparent and auditable data access

## 2. Limitations
- Prototype is tested mainly on testnet and simulated devices
- Scalability and performance on large-scale deployments not fully evaluated
- Real-time analytics and advanced user interfaces are not implemented

## 3. Future Work
- Deploy on mainnet and integrate with real IoT hardware
- Enhance scalability and optimize transaction costs
- Implement advanced analytics and visualization dashboards
- Integrate with additional security standards and compliance frameworks
- Explore interoperability with other IoT and blockchain platforms
