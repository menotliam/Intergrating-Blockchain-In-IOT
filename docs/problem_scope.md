# Problem Scope

## 1. Background
The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an explosion of data generated from various sources. However, the security and integrity of this data are often compromised due to vulnerabilities in device authentication, data transmission, and storage.

## 2. Challenges
- **Device Forgery:** Malicious actors can impersonate legitimate devices to inject false data.
- **Data Tampering:** Data transmitted from IoT devices can be intercepted and altered.
- **Lack of Data Provenance:** It is difficult to verify the origin and integrity of IoT data.
- **Centralized Trust Issues:** Traditional systems rely on centralized servers, which are single points of failure and targets for attacks.

## 3. Project Scope
This project aims to address the above challenges by integrating blockchain technology with IoT systems to:
- Ensure device authentication and data integrity.
- Provide immutable storage of data hashes on blockchain.
- Enable decentralized verification of data provenance.
- Support secure, scalable, and auditable IoT data management.

## 4. Out of Scope
- Real-time analytics and visualization of IoT data.
- Integration with legacy IoT platforms.
- Large-scale deployment on mainnet (focus is on testnet and prototype).
